## Brotopia: Breaking Up the Boys' Club of Silicon Valley by Emily Chang

women risk being objectified if they participate and shut out if they don’t.

A large study of high schoolers showed that young women have equal competence in the skills needed to use them. The results did, however, show that young women had more fear and less confidence, leading the researchers to conclude that the differences between boys and girls in terms of computer use reflected stereotyping and gender-role socialization.

The “geek mythology,” as Margolis calls it, was pervasive—students who were surveyed believed that geeks obsessed with computers made the best programmers, yet nearly 70 percent of women didn’t see themselves that way. Women began to question whether they even belonged at all.

Trilogy pioneered new recruiting strategies in the tech industry, selected a different type of computer programmer, and encouraged an insane amount of risk—all while helping to trademark the work-hard, party-harder brogrammer culture we’ve come to know,

When Steve Jobs used his charisma to overcome or hide inconvenient facts, people called it his reality distortion field.

What did these brainteasers actually test for? There is little to suggest that they had anything to do with being a good coder or engineer. More likely, they helped Trilogy hire people who were a cultural fit. The company was looking for people with extreme confidence—those who would happily riff on a problem about which they had no actual expertise.

The company was oriented towards drinking and working very hard. Everything was very intense.”

“When you have a culture that is so male dominated, where drinking is a huge part of the culture, where you’re talking about doing deals in the millions of dollars, every aspect of that is going to kind of reek of a certain mentality,” says Gary Chou. “It’s completely hostile for women.”

men consistently score higher than women when it comes to narcissistic traits such as exhibitionism, feelings of entitlement, and the willingness to employ unethical or exploitative behavior to get ahead.

good predictors of the sort of hyper self-confidence men are more prone to.

high-achieving women suffer from “imposter syndrome,” a term coined in 1978 by two psychologists, Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanne Imes, to summarize how women often feel undeserving of their success. Despite their concrete achievements, these researchers said, women often believe they are not that smart and will eventually be exposed as frauds.

The company was the early 1990s model for a type of bluster and risk taking that would come to characterize Silicon Valley over the next decade.

But while many midlevel employees were hurt when the bubble popped, some founders walked away with millions. Many became the venture capitalists whom we will meet in the next chapter, and because they had emerged from the economic rubble as winners, their idea of who should be running tech companies (young men) did not change. As VCs, their influence in the industry only grew stronger, while women’s position languished.

WHEN “MERITOCRACY” MEANS “PEOPLE LIKE US”

The idea that these men just happened to be personally connected to the most talented people available is simply ridiculous.

But despite their own admission that they were hiring from people they knew personally, Klement confirms that Thiel and other executives often talk about how PayPal was a meritocracy.

I do think there can be a sort of macho all-male environment of ‘We don’t make mistakes.’”

Rubenstein calls Slide’s alcohol problem and “ambient sexism” symptoms of “a culture of immature individuals.”

Young wasn’t advocating for a return to the old system, but he did see grave dangers in the new embrace of meritocracy, eerily predicting that in this new world, status would still be accessible only to a select few: those who had access to elite education. As a result, meritocracy would produce a new social stratification and a sense of moral exceptionalism.

says, a meritocracy is always based on an imperfect definition of merit and often narrowly defined to favor training, connections, and education primarily available to the wealthy.

Privilege accumulates as you advance in life.

Many people in Silicon Valley are greatly invested in the “self-made great man” story. But it is a story always told in retrospect, with little acknowledgment of all the factors that actually contribute to success.

When minorities are forced to self-identify as minorities, their performance suffers.

Sociologists even have a name for this: stereotype threat.

“If a woman failed an interview, a second committee was assigned to review the case,” a former Google executive tells me. It was called the Revisit Committee, and it included women engineers who would take a closer look at candidates on the verge of being denied.

The search engine battled disgruntlement among employees who believed that Google, with all of these diversity measures, was compromising its rightfully high standards for a seat on the rocket ship.

“A lot of people thought it was incumbent on them to find a reason not to hire someone. This is such an exclusive club that we need to poke and prod a person in such a way as to find any weakness, because so many people want to work here. But that gets a little crazy and you start dinging people for silly things,” Lee explains. “I think it hurts women and minorities more because there is a component of unconscious bias, but even absent of that, you have people looking for an affinity and people like them who come from the same backgrounds and can relate to them, instead of the core competencies of the job.”

“The underlying principle of meritocracy is that it works as long as your assessment of people is fair and unbiased,”

“The reality is that without support or training nobody is completely fair and unbiased.”

the relationships were often secret and when they were exposed it was the women, not the men, who were reassigned.

“The attributes and behaviors and skills that the majority of engineers on the technical side thought people should have—assertiveness, aggressiveness, that pick-it-apart urge, almost the hubris they had, was rewarded,” says Nancy Lee. “The things that get undervalued are things like collaboration, willingness to listen. Some of the skills women would bring to bear were simply not valued. Then you say they lack ‘merit’ and you get the reputation that it’s a little brogrammer.”

Being coldly rational and solving very specific computational puzzles, Zunger admits, is part of an engineer’s job and a requirement when learning to code and in the early days of one’s career. However, it is only after that stage, he says, that the “real engineering” begins. The true job of an engineer is to fix problems that exist in the real world. Those problems always involve understanding people.

The story of a brilliant woman who every day manages to prioritize both her work and her family just doesn’t fit that stereotype of the high-rolling, risk-taking genius tech revolutionary.

In addition, a lot of what’s hurting women now are the insidious, constant, smaller things. Every day things happen that can really quickly add up.” Maybe your boss interrupts you or gives credit for your ideas to someone else. It is difficult to complain because often the boss isn’t even aware of the behavior,

No ambitious, hardworking woman wants to be defined or thwarted by a few boneheaded men they have little choice but to work with.

The women who do work at these companies are generally more junior, a trend that preserves an old boys’ club power dynamic that often works against the young women’s advancement.

Many of the women pointed out that declining to drink with the boys is a double-edged sword. If women don’t participate, they’re seen as uptight and not team players. And they risk missing out on group-bonding time, which may cost them personal and political capital within the organization. If they do participate, they’re considered not serious and, worse, risk being sexualized or, as in Holmes’s case, even assaulted.

the “little things”—the small, daily insults that build up over time. These interactions are not necessarily intentional or malicious, but they have a cumulative effect.

When women were identified openly, the acceptance rate of their code went down.

It’s the constant emotional labor that she has to perform, day after day, just to keep her job and do her work. Often, women will not immediately blame sexism if they feel they are being mistreated or overlooked, rather they question themselves. “Did I do something wrong? Or, was I not clear enough?” they might think. These concerns wear constantly on self-esteem.

For me to get the same recognition as my peers, I have to do a great job and show why I’m worth being here. Being just as good isn’t enough; you have to be exceptional.”

In Silicon Valley, if you’re not a white man, your identity is a ball and chain, from which you cannot escape.

“It’s confusing how much was boys’ club and how much was just mismanagement,” Lee said. “I think VC has been a boys’ club, and even if many of those boys have great intentions, many of them don’t realize the privilege that they have being male and mostly white and how things they do or say may unintentionally make others feel excluded or uncomfortable or discouraged.

Not only are women less likely to receive venture capital than men, but they are also less likely to have business loan and credit applications approved.

men tend to set bigger goals for growth while women focus instead on making their business sustainable.

when a woman proposes the same idea, she can expect others to simultaneously be looking for cues that she in fact possesses the types of skills and traits needed to make a venture a success—abilities she’s often assumed to lack because of her gender.”

because most venture capitalists are men, they are likely to be more passionate about ideas that appeal to, well, men.

before the public shaming. Was “lots of research” really necessary for such basic insights? His statement alone reveals just how cloistered and cut off certain powerful men in Silicon Valley can become.

There is a huge morality issue in Silicon Valley and at the very core, it’s people with money thinking they can get away with everything.

It’s trying to blend the new and keeping the old attitudes, and those old attitudes are based in patriarchy, so they come at the expense of women.”

What she has found is that for a woman, pushing private sexual boundaries comes with a price.

“The trust works one way,” Ava says. “The stigma for a woman to do it is so much higher. I’m supposed to be in this industry where everyone is open and accepting but as a woman the punishment is so much more unknown.”

Men actually get business done at sex parties and strip clubs. But when women put themselves in these situations, they risk losing credibility and respect.

“The fact that you don’t go is weird,” the entrepreneur said, and it means being left out of important conversations.

The women who do say yes to these parties rarely see a big business payoff. “There is a desire to be included and invited to these kinds of things and sometimes it felt like it was productive to go and you could get ahead faster by cultivating relationships in this way,” one female tech worker told me. “Over time, I realized that it’s false advertising and it’s not something women should think is a way to get ahead.

Great companies don’t spring magically to life when a nerd gets laid three times in a row. Great companies are built in the office, with hard work put in by a team. The problem is that weekend views of women as sex pawns and founder hounders can’t help but affect weekday views of women as colleagues, entrepreneurs, and peers.

What I’m concerned about is the whole trend around nonmonogamy becomes another justification for not being responsible for yourself and that’s not the point. It’s not a get-out-of-jail-free card.

many still believe that for a Silicon Valley tech firm to be successful, programmers must put in superhuman hours.

These sorts of attitudes and expectations have given rise to the dude army and to campuses that look like college-dorm fantasylands instead of professional and inclusive workplaces for grown-ups.

I’m urging you, especially at the dawn of your career, to instead choose life over balance and make the work so meaningful that you wouldn’t want it to exist as a distinct concept. This is how you ensure that your future remains yours.”

“silently slandered” women with kids by negatively judging their job performance. She rolled her eyes when they couldn’t make post-work drinks, repeatedly questioned their commitment, scheduled last-minute meetings at 4:30 p.m., just when parents might be wrapping up so they could go pick up their kids, and stayed at work late simply to prove she was more dedicated to the job.

Studies show that in all fields working mothers are paid less and perceived as less competent than working fathers.

the winners will be those groups of young, single guys hacking all night, night after night, in a race to achieve their billion-dollar dreams. No families, no wives, no relationships, no real anything except the Product and the Dream.

The big inflection points at Quip, Taylor notes, had nothing to do with how much sleep was compromised for work. “In general, it’s because we made the right decision or the wrong decision about a resources allocation in terms of what are you working on or not working on. I believe that’s 100 percent why companies succeed or fail. It’s not how fast you’re typing.”

Mauskopf blogged that Winnie employees don’t work nights and weekends, because they know it will take a long time to solve the problem they are focused on and they don’t want to burn out. She also pointed out that many start-ups fail expressly due to burnout.

Our work is important but rarely is it the most important thing in our lives.

trolling playbook, an extremely effective technique used to silence women that anonymous social-media denizens disagree with.

Find the spot where the woman feels the most vulnerable and make her feel unsafe until the cost of speaking out is too great.”

Women, you’re not welcome here. And if you choose to show up anyway, be prepared to live with any harassment that comes your way.

“The foundations of the Internet were laid on free expression, but the founders just did not understand how effective their creation would be for the coordination and amplification of harassing behavior. Or that the users who were the biggest bullies would be rewarded with attention for their behavior . . .

“The purpose of free speech is to allow everybody to have a voice, to have these conversations, and if one group is pushing everybody else off you can have this free speech platform, but there are not many voices or opinions being represented.”

By creating hurdles to bad behavior that were minimal but real, it was able to change that behavior dramatically.

As VR becomes increasingly real, how do we decide what crosses the line from an annoyance to an actual assault?”

Job postings were reworded. According to Emerson, male-biased terms such as “rock star” and “ninja” are no-no’s, along with words such as “brilliant” that convey the belief that intelligence, talents, and abilities are innate, rather than traits that can be developed.

those who believe in your mission and how to execute it aren’t limited to people who look and act like you.

stop blaming everybody else for the problem or pretending that it is too hard for us to solve.
